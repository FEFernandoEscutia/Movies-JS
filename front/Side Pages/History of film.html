            The history of film chronicles the development
            of a visual art form created using film technologies that began in the late 19th century.
            The advent of film as an artistic medium is not clearly defined. There were earlier cinematographic
            screenings by others; however, the commercial, public screening of ten Lumi√®re brothers' short films
            in Paris on 28 December 1895 can be regarded as the breakthrough of projected cinematographic motion
            pictures. The earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long, without recorded sound, and
            consisted of a single shot from a steady camera. The first decade saw film move from a novelty to an
            established mass entertainment industry, with film production companies and studios established throughout
            the world. Conventions toward a general cinematic language developed, with film editing camera movements
            and other cinematic techniques contributing specific roles in the narrative of films.
            Popular new media, including television (mainstream since the 1950s), home video (1980s), and the internet (1990s),
            influenced the distribution and consumption of films. Film production usually responded with content to fit the new media,
            and technical innovations (including widescreen (1950s), 3D, and 4D film) and more spectacular films to keep theatrical screenings attractive.
            Systems that were cheaper and more easily handled (including 8mm film, video, and smartphone cameras) allowed for an increasing
            number of people to create films of varying qualities, for any purpose including home movies and video art. The technical quality
            was usually lower than professional movies, but improved with digital video and affordable, high-quality digital cameras.
            Improving over time, digital production methods became more popular during the 1990s, resulting in increasingly realistic visual effects
            and popular feature-length computer animations.
            Various film genres have emerged during the history of film, and enjoyed variable degrees of success.
            The use of film as an art form traces its origins to several earlier traditions in the arts such as (oral) storytelling, literature, 
            theatre and visual arts. Cantastoria and similar ancient traditions combined storytelling with series of images that were shown or indicated 
            one after the other. Predecessors to film that had already used light and shadows to create art before the advent of modern film technology 
            include shadowgraphy, shadow puppetry, camera obscura, and the magic lantern.
            Shadowgraphy and shadow puppetry represent early examples of the intent to use moving imagery for entertainment and storytelling.[1] Thought to 
            have originated in the Far East, the art form used shadows cast by hands or objects to assist in the creation of narratives. Shadow puppetry enjoyed 
            popularity for centuries around Asia
